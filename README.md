### Google Books API Search Engine

## Requirements / Purpose

-   The MVP was to create a search engine using the Google Books API. This project focuses on developing recently aquired knowledge of Javascript Promises, as well as incorporating all previously learnt topics, including DOM manipulation.
-   This project has been created with vanilla Javascript, CSS/Sass and HTML, as I wanted to further improve my function writing and DOM manipulation skills.

## Design Goals / Approach

-   I have created a simple user interface, which includes a search bar, result cards and a feature book card. To optimise user experience, I have chosen a font that is easily legible, paired with a low contrasting blue colour palette.

## Known issues

-   Feature card design and positioning could be improved upon.

## Future Goals

-   What are the immediate features you'd add given more time
-   Create bottom nav bar and explore how to see/load more search results on a new page.

## What did you struggle with?

1. Understanding how async/await functions works and the differences between async/awit and .then()/.catch(). As this was my first project that required fetching data from an API and appyling async functions, I struggled to understand how I could use array iterator methods on a promise, as it returns an object. I eventually worked out that I could use array iterators, and create iterator functions, as long as they are called within the asyn function.

2. Understanding the purpose of and how/when to use try/catch statements. This was my first time using tyr/catch statements in general and the MVP specified that .catch() should not be used. Through the project I applied try/catch statments in conjunction with DOM elements to display error messages.
